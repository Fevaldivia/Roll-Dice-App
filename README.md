# Roll the Dice 

This is a basic app that I contributed on my IOS Developer course in Udacity basically you have 2 dice always with you with this app 
generating random results to play with your friends

# Getting Started

This projects it's been developed usign Swift3 and Xcode 8.1 to run this project make sure that you are using the right Swift version and Xcode Version,
for doing that you can check your Swift version on your terminal with the next command line:

$ swift -version

Getting a result something like this: Apple Swift version 9.1

And if you need to check Xcode version just go to the upper left corner with your Xcode open and select the option called Xcode and select the first option named About Xcode inside that option you can see the version that you are using.
